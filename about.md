_All things Physics, Travel, Finance and Entrepreneurship._

## About

I studied maths and physics at university and now work in finance.

Outside of work, I write code (mostly in Python), build the occasional side project, and sometimes blog about the intersection of finance, physics, entrepreneurship and whatever else is on my mind. Iâ€™ve also been known to run (on a broken leg), play golf and padel, and spend far too long choosing paint colours for my living room.

(This is not easy).

All views are my own.
